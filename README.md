## ⚠️ Important Health Notes

> 💊 **Thyroid Medication:** Take Thyroxine 100mg with **lukewarm water only**, exactly **60 minutes before eating**. Never skip!

> 🧪 **TSH Check:** Get your TSH blood test done **every 6 weeks** during this journey. Weight loss affects thyroid levels.

> 💧 **Water:** Drink **3–3.5 litres per day**. More on workout days.

> 😴 **Sleep:** Aim for **7–8 hours every night**. Poor sleep raises cortisol and slows fat loss.

> 🚫 **Avoid:** Processed food, packaged snacks, refined sugar, refined oil, late-night eating.
